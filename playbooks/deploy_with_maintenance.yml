# This playbook is meant for deployments that introduce big changes and thus
# require enabling maintenance mode and refreshing the cache.
#
# It automates the steps previously documented in
# https://github.com/openfoodfoundation/ofn-install/wiki/Deployment-of-v2 but
# it can be used any other similar situations too.
#
# Do not forget to pass in the github_key to specify the version to deploy via
# the -e flag. `github_key=openfoodfoundation:v2.2.1` at the time of writing.
#
# Optionally, you might also want to provide a specific message for the
# maintenance page, which should be through the maintenance_mode_message var
# using the -e flag.
